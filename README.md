# Deploy a Web Application in AWS Elastic Kubernetes Service

Welcome to the Deploy a Web Application in AWS Elastic Kubernetes Service project. This project-based guide will walk you through deploying a web application on AWS Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS). Follow the outlined steps to complete the project efficiently.

## Project Objectives

This project focuses on three primary objectives:

1. **Build and Deploy**: Build a container image and deploy it to Elastic Container Registry.
2. **Elastic Kubernetes Cluster**: Create an Elastic Kubernetes cluster and deploy a web application.
3. **Scaling**: Scale the Elastic Kubernetes Cluster as needed.

Upon completion, you will be adept at deploying web applications in AWS Elastic Kubernetes Service with ease.

## Project Structure

The project is divided into the following tasks:

1. **Understanding Project Scope**: Familiarize yourself with project elements and basic aspects of Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Services.
2. **Setting Permissions**: Configure necessary permissions, roles, and policies.
3. **Creating Container Registry**: Establish an Elastic Container Registry and configure identities.
4. **Building and Pushing Docker Image**: Clone application from GitHub, build Docker image, and push it to Elastic Container Registry.
5. **Creating Kubernetes Cluster**: Set up an Elastic Kubernetes Cluster and configure.
6. **Configuring Node Group**: Create and configure a Node Group to host containers in a POD architecture.
7. **Deploying Application**: Deploy the application in Elastic Kubernetes Cluster using an image from Elastic Container Registry.
8. **Scaling**: Scale the Node Group to support increased pod requirements in the Kubernetes cluster.
9. **Environment Cleanup**: Properly clean up the environment to ensure efficient resource usage.
